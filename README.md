# akahu_to_budget
One-way sync of transactions from Akahu to either YNAB or Actual Budget.

We support both Actual Budget and YNAB.  You can sync to both or to just one.

# Project status

I started writing this script some time ago. As of 2024-12-28... I've finally swapped from using my old hodgepodge version to using this.
That means that today, it's feature complete but not yet battle-hardened.  If you're reading this notably after Dec 2024 then it should be pretty robust.

Also in terms of my personal setup, I haven't yet fully committed to giving up YNAB and an vascilating between YNAB and AB.  You might see oddities in the data 
created for AB (e.g. Payees, failing to trigger rules).  Please raise bugs.

# Setup

1. Create an Akahu account and an Akahu app: [https://my.akahu.nz/login](https://my.akahu.nz/login)
2. Optionally set up an OpenAI account and get an API key for smarter account mapping: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. Set up an Actual Budget Server and get the server URL, password, encryption key, and sync ID: [https://actualbudget.org/](https://actualbudget.org/).  I used PikaPods
4. And/OR in YNAB get a bearer token and the budget ID: [https://api.youneedabudget.com/](https://api.youneedabudget.com/)
5. Check out this repository
6. Create a virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. (see [.env.example](./.env.example))

Note that the OPENAI key is optional.  I included it more for fun.  It makes the matching a bit smarter.  In the future
I might make it so it tries to guess your category based on the transaction memo.

You can find an exammple .env file in this repository called .env.example - just rename it to .env

# Setup (detail)

Note that I have both YNAB and AB.  In theory this script supports running with either or both, but it's only been
tested with both.  If you have only one then please get in contact and let me know how you got on.

## Akahu 
To sign up to Akahu you need to create what they call personal API or a 'user scoped endpoint' as documented here
https://developers.akahu.nz/reference/api-akahu-io-authentication

Here's a picture from my setup

![Akahu Setup](documentation/akahu_setup.png)

## Actual Budget

I use pikapods for my setup.  You can sign up here: https://actualbudget.org/docs/install/pikapods/

Once you've signed up you can set up your accounts and create your budget.  If you're coming from YNAB then there's a tool: https://json-exporter-for-ynab.netlify.app/

I prefer to both have a password for my Actual Budget server AND to encrypt my data on Actual Budget.  That way even if
someone broke into PikaPods they wouldn't get automatic access to my financial data.  The code assumes you're doing this
too - you'll need to tweak it 

Now open your budget in YNAB and click 'show advanced settings'

## YNAB

You can create a personal API in YNAB as per the instructions https://api.ynab.com/

If you're the type of person who just wants to get up and running as quickly as possible and then circle back to fill in the gaps, these steps are for you:

1. Sign in to the YNAB web app and go to the "Account Settings" page and then to the "Developer Settings" page. 
2. Under the "Personal Access Tokens" section, click "New Token", enter your password and click "Generate" to get an access token.
3. Open a terminal window and run this:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.ynab.com/v1/budgets

## OpenAI

I haven't bothered to document this because it's optional.  The setup is similar to YNAB.

## Python

I always use a virtual environment for each project. I used Python 3.12 here, but most versions of Python 3 should work.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv

# Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Once activated
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want suggested matches while preparing account mappings, also install the setup dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_setup.txt
```

If you want to run the webhook server, also install the web dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_web.txt
```

# Preparing to run the script

Run `python akahu_budget_mapping.py`

This lets you interactively map your bank accounts with accounts set up in Actual Budget or YNAB.

It will ask you a bunch of questions like 
```Akahu Account: DAY TO DAY (Connection: Kiwibank)
Here is a list of actual accounts:
...
Enter the number corresponding to the best match (or press Enter to skip):
```

Ultimately this will write the file `akahu_budget_mapping.json`.

You will likely never need to run this again unless you want to change the mapping.

# Running the script

Run the script using:
```bash
# For one-time sync (recommended for most users):
python sync_cli.py

# For running the webhook server:
python flask_app.py
```

This connects to Akahu, gets the transactions, and syncs them to Actual Budget and/or YNAB.

When running the webhook server, the first sync is triggered automatically on startup. For subsequent syncs, use the web interface at http://localhost:5000/sync.
There is minimal security, mostly because the webhooks don't take parameters so the worst someone can do is sync your budget prematurely.

NOTE TO EXISTING USERS: If you're been using akahu_to_budget.py, we have finished the migration to `sync_cli.py` for one-time syncs and `flask_app.py` for the webhook server. `python flask_app.py --sync` is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.

# Running in a container

The repository ships a `Containerfile` (works with both `docker` and `podman`)
and publishes an image to GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main`
and on tagged releases:

- `ghcr.io/corrin/akahu_to_budget:latest` — latest `main`
- `ghcr.io/corrin/akahu_to_budget:v1.2.3` — specific tag

You still need to provide your `.env` file and the `akahu_budget_mapping.json`
you generated during setup. Mount them both into the container:

```bash
podman run --rm \
  --env-file ./.env \
  -v ./akahu_budget_mapping.json:/app/akahu_budget_mapping.json \
  ghcr.io/corrin/akahu_to_budget:latest
```

The container image runs one-off syncs and does not include Flask. Use host cron
or a systemd timer for scheduled container syncs.

Substitute `docker` for `podman` if you prefer. To build locally instead of
pulling:

```bash
podman build -t akahu_to_budget:local -f Containerfile .
```

# Running Tests

There are some tests to validate the API is still working.  You can probably ignore them.

# OpenAI

I set up the OpenAI key for mapping accounts more out of self-amusement.  I have also toyed with the idea of using it to clean payees, assign transactions to categories, etc.
For now it's not really doing anything.
